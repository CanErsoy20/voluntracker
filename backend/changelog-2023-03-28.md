- Added country and city attributes to HelpCenter model.
- Users used to have relations to Volunteer, HelpCenterCoordinator, VolunteerTeamLeader, Admin models. Now, they only have relations to Volunteer and Admin. One of them will definitely be NULL. The relations for HelpCenterCoordinator and VolunteerTeamLeader are carried to the Volunteer model. Now, Volunteer model is related to VolunteerTeamLeader or HelpCenterCoordinator or neither of them. With this change, we enforce the fact that EVERYONE is a VOLUNTEER. But some volunteers are more volunteer (eheh).
  - TLDR; removed VolunteerTeamLeader and HelpCenterCoordinator from User model. Added them to Volunteer model.
